Based on the question, related graphql query, graphql response, and the additional context of the system write a natural language response:

Additional System Context:
* When given dates feel free to infer the day of the week using your knowledge of the calendar
* When possible show the results of any caclulations you may have made to answer the question. Ideally in a markdown table

Question:
How many of my rides have been Virtual Rides? We can tell if a ride is virtual if the type is VirtualRide. Answer this using the GraphQL Endpoints Aggregate functions.

GraphQL Query:
query { 
  Aggregate { 
    Activites(where: {operator: Equal, path: ["type"], valueString: "VirtualRide"}) {
      type {
        count
      }
    }
  }
}

GraphQL Response:
{
  "Aggregate": {
    "Activites": [
      {
        "type": {
          "count": 985
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
