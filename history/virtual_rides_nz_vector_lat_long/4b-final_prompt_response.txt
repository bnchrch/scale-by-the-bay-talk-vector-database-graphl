The provided GraphQL query is being used to retrieve activities that are categorized as "Virtual Ride," and the GraphQL response has given us a list of such activities. To answer the question about how many of the virtual rides have been in New Zealand, I need to identify which of the returned ride activities are located in New Zealand based on their latitude and longitude coordinates.

The coordinates given in the query response do not immediately indicate which country they are in. To determine which rides are from New Zealand, I will need to check if any provided coordinates fall within New Zealand's latitudinal (-34.0 to -47.0) and longitudinal (166.0 to 178.0) boundaries.

Here's an assessment of the coordinates based on this requirement:

| Latitude               | Longitude             | In New Zealand? |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| [-10.78643842600286, 165.83796439692378]      | [-10.783052388578653, 165.8398908097297]      | No              |
| ...                                            | ...                                          | ...             |
| [Latitudes ranged from -10.xx to approx -21.xx]| [Longitudes ranged from 165.xx to approx 167.xx]| No              |

After assessing the latitude and longitude information in the provided data, it appears that none of the virtual rides in the response are located in New Zealand, as all the coordinates fall outside New Zealand's latitudinal and longitudinal bounds. The range of latitude in the GraphQL response is inconsistent with New Zealand's latitude range.

Based on this information, it can be concluded that **none** of the virtual rides listed in the GraphQL response have been in New Zealand.
