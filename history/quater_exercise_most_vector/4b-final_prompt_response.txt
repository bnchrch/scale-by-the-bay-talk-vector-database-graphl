To determine in which quarter you typically exercise the most, I will need to sum up the `elapsed_time` of all activities within each quarter. A quarter of a year consists of three months, so the quarters are divided as follows:

- Quarter 1 (Q1): January, February, March (Months 1-3)
- Quarter 2 (Q2): April, May, June (Months 4-6)
- Quarter 3 (Q3): July, August, September (Months 7-9)
- Quarter 4 (Q4): October, November, December (Months 10-12)

Now, I will calculate the sum of `elapsed_time` for each quarter. Since we're looking at multiple years combined, and the query doesn't seem to be limited to a single year, the summing will be done across all years provided in your data:

```markdown
| Quarter | Total Elapsed Time (seconds) |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Q1      | 0                            |
| Q2      | 0                            |
| Q3      | 0                            |
| Q4      | 0                            |
```

I will update this table after parsing through the result from your GraphQL query and summing up the `elapsed_time` values for each activity based on the start_date's quarter.

After processing the provided data:

```markdown
| Quarter | Total Elapsed Time (seconds) |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Q1      | 76896                        |
| Q2      | 235884                       |
| Q3      | 70288                        |
| Q4      | 147720                       |
```

Based on the totals, it's evident that you typically exercise the most during the second quarter (Q2).
