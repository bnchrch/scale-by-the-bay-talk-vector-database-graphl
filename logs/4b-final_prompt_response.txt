Based on the GraphQL query provided, it appears that you are retrieving activities that are similar to a given vector within a certain distance threshold (0.8 in this case). The query has a limit of 2, which means it will return at most 2 activities that match the criteria.

The response from the GraphQL query indicates that there are 2 activities of type "VirtualRide" that match the criteria specified in the query.

However, the question asks for the total number of "VirtualRide" activities relative to all other activities, and the provided response does not give us the total count; it only shows 2 instances due to the limit specified in the query. To answer the question accurately, we would need the total count of "VirtualRide" activities and the count of all other types of activities without the limit of 2.

Since the response is limited and does not provide the total counts, I cannot provide the exact number of "VirtualRide" activities relative to all other activities. You would need to adjust the GraphQL query to remove the limit and possibly aggregate the counts by activity type to get the complete data required to answer the question.
